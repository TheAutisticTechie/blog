# About Me

I currently work for Interchange & Consort Hotels (who operate as Best Western GB and the parent company to Beacon Purchasing) as the Network Security Engineer since February 2020. My team look after the Infrastructure, Network and Security of the estate, as well as the hotels that use us as their service provider.

Previously, I have worked for multiple Managed Service Providers (MSP) in the Yorkshire region as a Senior Engineer, and even as a web developer for a while. Over the years I've worked with medium enterprises such as Bericap, Tennants Fine Chemicals and Hull City AFC, as well as many small enterprises and charities.

This blog has been launched with two goals:

1. Share projects I've worked on
2. Help educate people of varying skill levels

To do this, I'm planning on doing various blog series running through projects I've previously done and have upcoming. These projects include training, helpdesk configuration, network replacements, starting up a blue team and many more.
