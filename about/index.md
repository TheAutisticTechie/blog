# dltmurphy

My name is something something something Murphy as you may be able to guess. I've been in tech since 2011 after sitting my final school exams. Since then I've worked for MSPs, MSSPs and ISPs (Managed Service Providers, Managed Security Service Providers and Internet Service Providers) as a developer, infrastructure engineer, solutions architect, and management. I currently work for Interchange & Consort Hotels (who operate as Best Western GB and the parent company to Beacon Purchasing) as the Network Security Engineer.

My team looks after the Infrastructure, Network and Security of the estate, as well as the hotels that use us as their service provider. Over the years I've worked with medium enterprises such as Bericap, Tennants Fine Chemicals and Hull City AFC, as well as **many** small enterprises and charities.

This blog has been launched with two goals:

1. Share projects I've worked on
2. Help educate people of varying skill levels

To do this, I'm planning on running through projects I've previously done and have upcoming
